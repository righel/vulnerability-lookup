Vulnerability-Lookup Changelog
==============================

## 2.2.0 (Not Yet Released)

### What's New

- **Identity**:
  - Vulnerability-Lookup now has a beautiful new logo.

- **New Statistics Namespace**:
  The API now offers a dedicated namespace for statistics. Two new endpoints are currently available:
  - `/api/stats/vulnerability/most_sighted`
  - `/api/stats/vulnerability/most_commented`
  Both endpoints provide the option to return results in a Markdown table format.
  ([7a2b8ed](https://github.com/cve-search/vulnerability-lookup/commit/7a2b8edf717d492452efb100158678606c7ac9de),

- **New Client for KEV Sightings**:
  A new Python client, [KevSight](https://pypi.org/project/kevsight/), is available to generate sightings for Vulnerability-Lookup using the [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).
  For more details, refer to the [Vulnerability-Lookup documentation](https://vulnerability.circl.lu/documentation/sightings.html#automation) on sightings automation and the available clients.


### Changes

- **API Enhancements**:
  - Numerous improvements and harmonization across the API while maintaining
    compatibility with previous versions.
    [PyVulVulnerabilityLookup](https://github.com/cve-search/PyVulnerabilityLookup) has been updated.

    commitment to creating  software that is inclusive and usable for everyone.
