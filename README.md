Vulnerability-Lookup facilitates quick correlation of vulnerabilities from various sources,
independent of vulnerability IDs, and streamlines the management of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD).
Vulnerability-Lookup is also a collaborative platform where users can comment on security advisories and create bundles.

A Vulnerability-Lookup instance operated by [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu)
is available at [https://vulnerability.circl.lu](https://vulnerability.circl.lu).

## Features

- **API**: A comprehensive and fast lookup API for searching vulnerabilities and identifying correlations by vulnerability identifier.
- **Feeders**: Modular system to import vulnerabilities from different sources.
- **CVD process**: Creation, edition and fork/copy of Security Advisories with the [vulnogram editor](https://github.com/Vulnogram).
  Support of local vulnerability source per Vulnerability-Lookup instance.
- **Sightings**: Users have the possibility to add observations to vulnerabilities with different types of sightings, such as:
  *seen*, *exploited*, *not exploited*, *confirmed*, *not confirmed*, *patched*, and *not patched*.
- **Comments**: Ability to add, review and share comments on vulnerability advisories.
- **Bundles**: Possibility to create bundles of vulnerability advisories with a description.
- **RSS/Atom**: An extensive RSS and Atom support for vulnerabilities and comments.
- **EPSS**: Integration of the Exploit Prediction Scoring System.

The official documentation is available [here](https://www.vulnerability-lookup.org/documentation).

## Sighting Sources

Vulnerability-Lookup facilitates the recording of vulnerability sightings, regardless of whether they have been published by a source.
A suite of sighting clients is already available to support this functionality:

- **Fediverse** - [A sighting client to gather vulnerability-related information from the Fediverse](https://pypi.org/project/FediVuln)
- **MISP** - [A sighting client that retrieves vulnerability observations from a MISP server and pushes them to a Vulnerability-Lookup instance](https://pypi.org/project/VulnerabilityLookupSighting)
- **Nuclei** - [A sighting client designed to retrieve vulnerability-related information from the Nuclei Git repository of templates.](https://pypi.org/project/NucleiVuln)
- **Exploit-DB** - [A client that retrieves vulnerability observations from Exploit-DB and pushes them to a Vulnerability-Lookup instance](https://pypi.org/project/ExploitDBSighting)
- **CISA KEV** - [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog](https://pypi.org/project/kevsight)
- **RSS** - [Newspipe](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/newspipe) is a web news aggregator capable to detect various types of security
  advisories within articles.

If you want to create your own sigthing tool, it's recommended to use [PyVulnerabilityLookup](https://github.com/cve-search/PyVulnerabilityLookup),
a Python library to access Vulnerability-Lookup via its REST API.
