Presentation
------------

`Vulnerability-Lookup <https://www.vulnerability-lookup.org>`_ facilitates quick correlation of vulnerabilities
from various sources, independent of vulnerability IDs, and streamlines the management of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD).
Vulnerability-Lookup is also a collaborative platform where users can comment on security advisories and create bundles.

A Vulnerability-Lookup instance operated by `CIRCL <https://www.circl.lu>`_ is available at https://vulnerability.circl.lu.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- **API**: A comprehensive and fast lookup API for searching vulnerabilities and identifying correlations by vulnerability identifier.
- **Feeders**: Modular system to import vulnerabilities from different sources.
- **CVD process**: Creation, edition and fork/copy of Security Advisories with the `vulnogram editor <https://github.com/Vulnogram>`_.
  Support of local vulnerability source per Vulnerability-Lookup instance.
- **Sightings**: Users have the possibility to add observations to vulnerabilities with different types of sightings, such as:
  *seen*, *exploited*, *not exploited*, *confirmed*, *not confirmed*, *patched*, and *not patched*.
- **Comments**: Ability to add, review and share comments on vulnerability advisories.
- **Bundles**: Possibility to create bundles of vulnerability advisories with a description.
- **RSS/Atom**: An extensive RSS and Atom support for vulnerabilities and comments.
- **EPSS**: Integration of the Exploit Prediction Scoring System.
